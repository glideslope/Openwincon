Using the LORANGA board
=======================

The [LORANGA](https://www.alegrefactory.com/loranga) board from "La Fabrica Alegre" company embeds an RFM95W as the LoRa module. This module needs PABOOST so in order to use the module you first have to edit radio.makefile and make sure that PABOOST is enabled:

	CFLAGS=-DPABOOST -DMAX_DBM=14
	
Then, run the scripts/basic_config_gw.sh to both configure your gateway and compile the lora_gateway program.	

Starting Internet connection
----------------------------

The support of [LORANGA](https://www.alegrefactory.com/loranga) board has been realized in collaboration with "La Fabrica Alegre" development team.

They have the following [test github](https://github.com/edu986/test_ppp) to explain the installation of the support of the LORANGA board. Note that the wvdial method explained for 3G USB dongles is currently not working with the LORANGA board.

If you use our latest version of SD card image (from September 2017) then everything is set-up to use the LORANGA board. You just have to run:

	> cd /home/pi/lora_gateway/3GDongle/loranga
	> ./start-internet.sh

To start the 2G/3G Internet connection at boot, run:

	> ./enable-loranga-internet-on-boot.sh
	
This simple script simply creates a file called use_loranga_internet_on_boot.txt. The start_gw.sh script, called at boot time, now checks for this file and will run the start-internet.sh script before launching the gateway program and post-processing stage. However, it is safer to test it first in interactive mode to see how the ppp connection is going. Once you are supposed to have Internet, try to ping some remote computers or use the web admin interface to see whether the gateway has Internet or not. 

You can provide a parameter to start-internet.sh when testing in interactive mode. With no parameters, pppd logs are sent to stdout with is not very convenient. You can use:

	> ./start-internet.sh "logfile pppd.log"
	
To redirect pppd logs to pppd.log (in the /home/pi/lora_gateway/3GDongle/loranga folder). If you don't want any logs, run:

	> ./start-internet.sh nolog	

When pppd is started at boot for an operational gateway, start-internet.sh is run without any parameters but it is not important because the logs will not appear on stdout. We did not want to have logs in a file because we want to avoid having a log file that can grow quite fast. However, if you want to have the logs saved in a file, you can just edit /home/pi/lora_gateway/scripts/start_gw.sh and add "logfile pppd.log" after ./start-internet.sh.

Use stop-internet.sh to stop the pppd process and power-off the LORANGA board. Also, you can disable the usage of LORANGA on boot with:

	> ./disable-loranga-internet-on-boot.sh
	
which simply deletes the use_loranga_internet_on_boot.txt file. 	

Sending SMS
-----------

In order to use the LORANGA board for sending SMS with CloudSMS.py, you just have to edit (or create) in your /home/pi folder the .gammurc file:

	[gammu]
	device = /dev/ttyS0
	name = loranga
	connection = at
	
That should work, even if gammu-detect is not returning anything. If you want to try if SMS support is working, first kill all gateway processes (option K of cmd.sh) then edit clouds.json to enable CloudSMS.py:

	{	
		"name":"SMS Service",
		"script":"python CloudSMS.py",
		"type":"smsservice",
		"gammurc_file":"/home/pi/.gammurc",
		"enabled":true,
		"always_enabled":true
	},

Then edit key_SMS.py to indicate the phone number that will receive the SMS (it is better to disable the SIM card PIN with your mobile phone prior to insert the SIM card in the LORANGA board):

	contacts=["+33xxxxxxxxx"]
		
Then start manually the gateway:

	> sudo python start_gw.py
	
And use an end-device (our interactive device for instance) to send "\!TC/22.5" to the gateway. You should see something like:

	--- rxlora. dst=1 type=0x10 src=6 seq=2 len=9 SNR=6 RSSIpkt=-57 BW=125 CR=4/5 SF=12

However, currently, **it is not possible to have Internet connectivity and SMS support at the same time**. Therefore, if you want to enable the LORANGA SMS feature at boot time, run:

	> ./enable-loranga-SMS-on-boot.sh
	
This simple script simply creates a file called use_loranga_SMS_on_boot.txt. The start_gw.sh script, called at boot time, now also checks for this file and will power on the modem before launching the gateway program and post-processing stage. You can disable the usage of Loranga SMS on boot with:

	> ./disable-loranga-SMS-on-boot.sh
	
which simply deletes the use_loranga_SMS_on_boot.txt file. Note that if you have both use_loranga_Internet_on_boot.txt and use_loranga_SMS_on_boot.txt then the priority is the Internet connection. Remember to use disable-loranga-internet-on-boot.sh if you want only the SMS features.	

Raspberry PI Zero
-----------------
	
If you use the latest image, it also works on the new Raspberry Zero W (with the default behavior to act as a WiFi access point so you can easily use ssh pi@192.168.200.1 once you are connected to the gateway's WiFi). It can therefore be used to build and even lower-cost and more compact LoRa gateway. Note that regarding the serial port, the Raspberry PI Zero W is similar to the Raspberry PI 3, so /dev/ttyS0 is used, and not /dev/ttyAMA0.
